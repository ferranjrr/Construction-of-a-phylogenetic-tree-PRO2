# Construction-of-a-phylogenetic-tree-PRO2
My first object-oriented programming project in C++. Documentation is rendered via [Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl/).
This project was developed in the subject Programming II ([PRO2](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/bachelors-degrees/bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering/curriculum/syllabus/PRO2)) in Facultat d'Inform√†tica de Barcelona ([FIB](https://www.fib.upc.edu/)), [UPC](https://www.upc.edu/ca), during the course 2019-2020. 

Documentation (language: Spanish and Catalan) and evaluation of this laboratory practice is in folder `instructions, documentation and evaluation`. Documentation of the different classes created was rendered via Doxygen, located in folder [`DOC`](./DOC). For viewing and interacting with it, download the [`DOC`](./DOC) folder and open [`DOC/html/index.html`](./DOC/html/index.html) in a browser, for example, Google Chrome.

There were different deliveries which corresponds to the different Zip files.

Final mark: 9.52 out of 10.
